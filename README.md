Python in high school - volume 1
================================

Python is the ideal language to learn programming.
It is a powerful language that will allow you to dive into the world of algorithms. 

This book guides you step by step through original mathematical and computer activities adapted to the high school. It is complemented by online resources: color sheets and the full codes. You have everything you need to succeed!


Help wanted
===========

I am looking for people whose mother tongue is English and who would like to read the whole book (or some chapters) again:

* on the one hand to correct the sentences,
* on the other hand to verify that the terms for mathematics and computer science are well used.

Feel free to contact me!

The book will be on sale on Amazon at cost price (once it has been finalized).
